\cvline{Abstract}
{\small Since 2008 a new RFID-Tag system in the width of 2.45GHz from SIEMENS can not just be identified but 
localized with mobile hot spot accesspoints. Also writing information to the RFID-Tags is possible.
We tested throughput and scalability and designed and implemented a prototype of an end user application}
